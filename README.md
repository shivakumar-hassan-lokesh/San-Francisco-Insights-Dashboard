# San Francisco County Insights Dashboard: Comprehensive Zip Code Analysis

This project analyzes and visualizes socioeconomic and demographic data across San Francisco zip codes to generate a **Comprehensive Regional Score** using Tableau.  

## Methodology
- **Normalization**: Converted all variables to a 0–10 scale.
  - Positive indicators (education, income, employment, population): higher = better.
  - Negative indicators (crime rate, housing prices): higher = worse.
- **Weighting**:  
  - Population (10%)  
  - Education (20%)  
  - Employment Rate (20%)  
  - Median Household Income (20%)  
  - Housing Prices (10%)  
  - Crime Rate (20%)  
- **Comprehensive Score**: Weighted sum of normalized scores.
